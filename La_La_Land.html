    <p>I am honestly awed by Madonna's evergreen song <i>Material Girl</i> which I picked up in a resurgence thanks to some insta trend. Drawing inspiration from <i>Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend</i> which was performed by none other than Marilyn Monroe, Madonna has set the stage to be the Material Girl of the era.</p>

    <p>It isn't surprising that this song along with <i>Like a Virgin</i>launched the career of Madonna. The song video starts with a conversation between two men in the industry discussing how she could be a major star that just might have transcended into the real world. The director shown in the video is interested in her and we get to see two sides of Madonna through his chase which adds the layer the song is about. There is reel Madonna dressed in a pink jeweled with diamonds much of what the song is about and then there is real Madonna unimpressed by the gifts that belong to her reel version.</p>

    <p>I will admit I don't understand the fabled 'American Pie' by Don McLean but I sincerely love it. This 8-minute saga of a song has been hailed as one of the best songs in country music through generations. One has to give it to McLean for the creativity the song sparks with an almost incomprehensible story. Who is driving the Chevy to the levee? Who is the widowed bride? What about the day the music died? A relatively dry critical analysis is coming your way.

    <p>I am convinced there does not exist anything in the world sexier than the current git system. This collaboration tool was a gift to humanity from the gods of computer engineers. One particular god who brought this to existence is Linus Torvalds more famously known for creating Linux.</p>

    <p>A while ago, I was searching for some simulating TV show and came across Gilmore Girls. I was familiar with the creator Amy Sherman Palladino's other more recent work The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel which without a doubt was the most colorful show I have watched. It turns out Gilmore Girls was the precedent of Mrs. Maisel for the style of dialogue. The characters love talking for long periods and it really shows the depth. Spanning across 3 generations of women and set in an imaginary small town called Stars Hollow the show excels in giving the perfect 'Spring Vibe'.  It is always spring in the show!
    </p>

    <p>The main characters of the story are the mother-daughter duo both named Lorelai but the daughter has taken up the pet name Rory to avoid confusion. We see the journey of Rory's teenage years and Lorelai's 30s pursuing love and life. The core of the show is really the conversation between these two sharp-wit women filled with intense humor and pop references loaded with ironical banter seemingly unknown to others. There is also Lorelai's mom Emily which makes up for the third generation who is an upper class women with privileges Lorelai had aversion to.

    <p>I hate ChatGPT. I despise the prose coming out of it even though I can't distinguish between human and AI generated at this point. Call it boomer instincts if you may but there is something so sinister about AI art. I do recognize the efforts that went into it which made the AI what it is now. I had known some of the OpenAI's contributions and the challenges they took to train the beast ChatGPT is now today. I remember OpenAI's name coming in Dota2 strangely when they decided that they will beat the current Dota champions, the TI8 and TI9 winner team <i>OG</i> in their own game. And they did so. Almost. The caveat was that they limited the hero pool and items hero could possess but the mechanics remained the same. OpenAI became a hero for me after this achievement.

    <p>I have a lot of friends working in machine learning, so I can naively see that behind all these models lie huge amount of programming and statistics designed to learn and approximate.</p>
