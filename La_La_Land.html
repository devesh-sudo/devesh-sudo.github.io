    <p>मेरी सबसे प्रिय हिंदी फिल्म आनंद ही होगी। राजेश खन्ना और अमिताभ बचनन की सबसे यादगार फिल्म एक डॉक्टर के अजूबे मरीज की कहानी है जिसने उसकी जिंदगी बदल दी। यह गाना में पहली बार हमें आनंद के मन की झलक दिखती है जिसका किरदार राजेश खन्ना ने खूबी से निभाया है। वह आदमी जिसे जल्द ही अपनी अंत का सामना करना होगा कैसे भयभीत नहीं हो सकता। आनंद इसी भय के ऊपर जीत का नाम है।</p>

    <p>Indian hip-hop peaked here. This song weirdly reminds me of GTA game and what an Indian adaption would have looked like. Introducing <i>Blonde Travolta</i>, <i>Angry Sikh</i>, <i>Pretee Kaur</i> and load of background characters dancing with unique styles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panjabi_MC" target="_blank">Panjabi MC</a> created a piece of art which will be forever remembered as <i>the</i> Bhangra tune to dance to. The video is not even shot in India, this is Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.</p> 

    <p>Blonde Travolta seems to be some kind of low lifer who has borrowed money from Angry Sikh and he is after him. And Preetee Kaur is just there. She is the Barbie in this universe deep into her own world. Her gaze and aura will bind you with split shots of different corners of Indian culture. There are Hindu deities, depiction of rituals, Angry Sikh in a stunning kurta</p>
    <p>The song just brings joy. That rhythm makes you move your legs and shoulders and will transport you to somewhere in India believe it or not. </p>
    <p>I am not good at Punjabi but I'll try anyway. The lyrics are trying to warn a young girl about boys. The title literally translate to 'Beware of The Boys'</p>
    <center><h2 id="Hinglish">The case of Hinglish</h2></center>
    <center><h3>10th June 2023</h3></center>
    <p>I have recently developed a tick for translating common English words into Hindi words, the opposite of what I had to do in school. Do you remember that Hindi for more is अधिक<!--(ज़्यादा which is much commonly used is Persian origin)-->, air-conditioned is वातानुकूलित, request is आग्रह? It comes from a desire to reconnect with the language but I am not particularly successful in it. And it makes sense, the last time I had written anything in Hindi was 8 years ago. Still can't do it.</p>

    <p>Some English words seeping into common vocabulary make up for interesting linguistic phenomenons. My favorite one has to be the replacement of 'इस्तेमाल' by 'use' simply because of more syllables. No one nowadays (at least around me) says 'इस्तेमाल' because 'use' is far easier to say. Similarly, 'time' has replaced 'समय' almost everywhere. Another (cute) Gen-Z thing to do now is to insert specific Hindi words in an otherwise English sentence - I will <i>pukka</i> come tomorrow, How was your <i>garmi chutti</i>? But there is a line set by the same Gen-Z that shall not be crossed. When the much anticipated Bollywood song <i>Kesariya</i> was released, people were enraged by the lyrics. This wasn't the first song with Hinglish lyrics, but it might be the first song with a weird fusion of Hindi grammar for an English word which left a bad taste for many including myself. </p>

    <p>And it's not just Hindi, the emergence of terms like Franglais, Spanglish, and Japanglish demonstrates the effects of English globalization. France has a language institute where part of the job is to keep coming up with French translations for upcoming English words because who would have thought <i>un logiciel</i> is how French kids should learn about computer software. There was a hilarious debate in 2020 about whether COVID should be masculine or feminine in <i>Français</i>, and they came up with the resolution that it's <i>la COVID</i> despite many people saying <i>le COVID</i>. Hindi speakers seem to have unanimously agreed that COVID is masculine as has been the case with the gender of most English words. </p>

    <p>I am curious how this compares to other language integrations humans have witnessed. One can write an entire thesis on the assimilation of Hindi and Urdu; they are practically the same language with different scripts. However, the mix of Hindi and English feels a little different primarily because of how far their origins are. Their merge won't be as beautiful as Hindi-Urdu but still worth thinking about since it's inevitable.</p> 

    <p>Also at the risk of sounding like a Hindu fundamentalist, I will say that there should be some effort to preserve Hindi and I am aware of the irony of writing this in English. The current government has some incentive for this. There is a cultural committee for the protection of the language with regular notices in Hindi and a surprising part I found was an <i>e-Mahashabdkosh</i> hosted on this <a href="http://e-mahashabdkosh.rb-aai.in/" target="_blank">website</a> which frankly is great. Another part of the department is concerned with creating necessary technical integrations for the Devanagari script to survive on the internet.</p>

    <p>Don McLean has my heart for writing this. Arguably one of the most beautiful songs ever written. It was through this song I learned about Vincent van Gogh and not the other way. Vincent the art and the artist. The picture and the painter. The genius and the troubled soul. The lover and the unloved.</p>

    <center><blockquote><i>For they could not love you<br>
      But still your love was true<br>
      And when no hope was left in sight<br>
      On that starry, starry night<br>
      You took your life, as lovers often do<br>
      But I could've told you, Vincent<br>
      This world was never meant for<br>
      One as beautiful as you<br></i></blockquote></center>
    
    <p>Sometimes I go through this song again and again just to listen to this part. The hard hitting lyrics describes the end of Vincent's life which just couldn't have been written any better. He committed suicide after struggling </p>

    <center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6p-lDYPR2P8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
    <p>I am honestly awed by Madonna's evergreen song <i>Material Girl</i> which I picked up in a resurgence thanks to some insta trend. Drawing inspiration from <i>Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend</i> which was performed by none other than Marilyn Monroe, Madonna has set the stage to be the Material Girl of the era.</p>

    <p>It isn't surprising that this song along with <i>Like a Virgin</i> launched the career of Madonna. The song video starts with a conversation between two men in the industry discussing how she could be a major star that just might have transcended into reality. The director shown in the video is interested in her and we get to see two sides of Madonna through his chase which adds a much necessary layer. There is a reel Madonna dressed in a (iconic) pink satin gown jeweled with heavy diamond necklaces and bracelets much of what the song is about and then there is the real Madonna unimpressed by the gifts that belong to her reel version. The reel version is showered with jewels from rich tuxedo-clad men who are carrying her across the stage like in Monroe's song. In between the takes the real version is rejecting the advances of other men still trying to dazzle her, <i>while</i> accepting the gifts. The director, however is successful in escaping this charade by adopting from the mistakes of others. <!--It's not like he knew the difference between the reel and the real at the beginning which we see in the video but he seems to be quite observant.--> Well maybe flowers and a milk truck date can also be a girl's best friend given the context. </p>
    <center><blockquote><i>Boys may come and boys may go<br>
      And that's all right you see<br>
      Experience has made me rich<br>
      And now they're after me</i> </blockquote></center>
    <p> Coming to the lyrics, they set in stone what being a material girl is about. The materialistic world demands materialistic needs and thou shall have it. The cold hard diamonds should come should accompany the soft warm touch, an eye-turning face necessitates eye-gathering dresses. Part of which has been in fashion since pop fashion was invented;<!--which shall be fulfilled <i>'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
      Is always Mister Right</i>.--> </p>

    <p>Maybe there is a tale about the glamorization of wealth hidden somewhere here.  I like how there is no mention of the other side in the lyrics which is probably how it came to a trend again. </p>

    <p>I will admit I don't understand the fabled 'American Pie' by Don McLean but I sincerely love it. This 8-minute saga of a song has been hailed as one of the best songs in country music through generations. One has to give it to McLean for the creativity the song sparks with an almost incomprehensible story. Who is driving the Chevy to the levee? Who is the widowed bride?

    <p>After years of requesting from the fans McLean revealed the drafts of the lyrics and what the song is on.</p>

    <p>A while ago, I was searching for some simulating TV show and came across Gilmore Girls. I was familiar with the creator Amy Sherman Palladino's other more recent work The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel which without a doubt was the most colorful show I have watched. It turns out Gilmore Girls was the precedent of Mrs. Maisel for the style of dialogue. The characters love talking for long periods and it really shows the depth. Spanning across 3 generations of women and set in an imaginary small town called Stars Hollow the show excels in giving the perfect 'Spring Vibe'.  It is always spring in the show!
    </p>

    <p>The main characters of the story are the mother-daughter duo both named Lorelai but the daughter has taken up the pet name Rory to avoid confusion. We see the journey of Rory's teenage years and Lorelai's 30s pursuing love and life. The core of the show is really the conversation between these two sharp-wit women filled with intense humor and pop references loaded with ironical banter seemingly unknown to others. There is also Lorelai's mom Emily which makes up for the third generation who is an upper class women with privileges Lorelai had aversion to.

    <center><h3>30th April 2023</h3></center>
    <p>I hate ChatGPT. I despise the prose coming out of it even though I can't distinguish between human and AI generated at this point. Call it boomer instincts if you may but there is something so sinister about AI art. I do recognize the efforts that went into it which made the AI what it is now. I had known some of the OpenAI's contributions and the challenges they took to train the beast ChatGPT is now today. I remember OpenAI's name coming in Dota2 strangely when they decided that they will beat the current Dota champions, the TI8 and TI9 winner team <i>OG</i> in their own game. And they did so. Almost. The caveat was that they limited the hero pool and items hero could possess but the mechanics remained the same. OpenAI became a hero for me after this achievement.
    </p>
    <p>I have a lot of friends working in machine learning, so I can naively see that behind all these models lie huge amount of programming and statistics designed to learn and approximate.</p>
