    <h1>On Geometry in General</h1>
    <center><h3>2nd May 2023</h3></center>
    <p>Disclaimer: I am still largely inexperienced in the ways of geometry. These are just some thoughts I have collected over the years and need not be accurate, but I still wanted to share. Also, this one will be a descriptive article with almost no technical details.</p>
    <p> It has been a long pressing question for me to find out what is the goal of doing differential geometry in the large and what is the future of the field. A typical question to throw is the classification problem - if you're doing algebra classify all groups, rings, modules, fields; if you're doing analysis classify all Hilbert spaces, functions between spaces; if you're doing topology classify all spaces up-to homeomorphism and it is a great question to ask in geometry as well. What are all the Riemannian manifolds? Like other subfields this seems to be an incredibly difficult and almost unsolvable problem. </p>
    <p> So we do what is most common and add more conditions/structures on manifolds. The question of what good manifolds are is the tricky one I feel. One condition to consider is possession of a large isometry group, i.e. the best manifold should be very symmetric. A popular definition in this regard is the definition of homogenous spaces. A space \(X\) is said to be homogenous if it is equipped with a transitive action of a group \(G\).  This is pretty close to the spirit of Erlangen program.</p>
    <p>At Sorbonne my advisors Prof. Alix Deruelle and Prof. Gilles Courtois introduced me to a question by Heinz Hopf of finding the best metric on a given smooth manifold. Best is subjective and we can have various definitions. For two dimensions the problem is easy to consider and has been completely solved for compact manifolds. Here the best metric is the metric with constant curvature and Uniformization theorem gives a complete answer. For three dimension there is Thurston conjecture that one can break a three manifold into pieces with canonical geometry but I am not really familiar with this theory (there is a lot happening on the topological side as well).</p>
    <p> Another approach considered for best metric is to think of metrics coming from critical values of a functional. One example is the scalar curvature functional which gives Einstein metrics as critical metrics. On the complex side there is a subfield based out of study of critical points of the Calabi functional which I am completely unaware of. In fact there is an entire book 'A Perspective on Canonical Riemannian Metrics' by Giovanni Catino and Paolo Mistrolia which explores some meanings one can associate with the best metric.</p>
    <!--<p>One source of a very broad perspective of geometry I recently got to know about is Yau's big  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602363" target="_blank">survey paper</a></p>. -->
