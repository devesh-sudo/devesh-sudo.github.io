      <center><h3>5th March 2025</h3></center>

      <p>The notion of convexity is central to many areas of mathematics ranging from PDEs to combinatorics. There is a book by Lars H&oumlrmander titled <i>Notions of convexity</i> exploring convexity in various branches. The first definition of convexity comes from geometry; a set is said to be convex if for any two points in the set, the line segment joining them is in the set too. I will be concentrating on the Brunn-Minkowski theory in convex geometry which is concerned with mixed volume and various measures coming from Minkowski addition of convex bodies. Given two convex bodies \(A, B \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}\) we can simply add all possible combinations of points in these and define \(A+B = \{a+b | a \in A, b \in B\}\) and it turns out to be a convex set. Moreover a convex set scaled by a positive numbers is also a convex set. These two operations allow us to do some kind of calculus in set of convex bodies which is even rich enough to get some Sobolev inequalites. A.D. Aleksandrov exploited this calculus really well leading to a number of far reaching results in convex geometry.</p>

      <p>One of the cornerstones in Brunn-Minkowski theory is the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. It states that under Minkowski addition volume power function \(V(\cdot)^{\frac{1}{n}}\) is concave. Specifically, \[V(\lambda A + (1-\lambda)B)^{\frac{1}{n}} \ge \lambda V(A)^{\frac{1}{n}} + (1-\lambda)V(B)^{\frac{1}{n}} \qquad \forall \, \lambda \in [0,1].\]
      
      Because \(V(\cdot)^{\frac{1}{n}}\) is degree one homogenous, the ineuqality is equivalent to a multiplicative form \(V(\lambda A + (1-\lambda)B) \ge V(A)^{\lambda}V(B)^{1-\lambda}\) which can be proved using Pr&eacutekopa-Leindler inequality. Brunn-Minkwoski theorem doesn't require \(A\) and \(B\) to be convex but I guess it was proved that way first. The ineuqality is valid as long as the Minkowski added sets are measurable. A really great exposition which every source recommends about Brunn-Minkowski inequality is Gardner's article <i>The Brunn-Minkowski inequality</i>.
      </p>

      <p>Steiner obtained a polynomial formula for \(V(K+tB)\) in dimension \(2\) and \(3\) where \(K\) is a bounded convex set, \(t\) is a positive real number and \(B\) denotes the ball of unit radius. He proved that this function is a polynomial in \(t\) and the linear cofficient in this expansion is area of the convex set. Formally, \[A(K) = \lim_{t \to 0^+}\frac{V(K+tB)-V(K)}{t}\] essentially saying that area is a differential of volume. This settles the question I had in school wondering why the derivative of volume of sphere \(V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) gives the surface area of the sphere \(A(r) = 4 \pi r^2\). Steiner formula along with Brunn-Minkowski theorem easily establishes isoperimetric inequality for convex sets.</p>

      <p>A quick road to Steiner formula at least for \(C^2_{+}\) bodies can be traversed as follows. I will be following notation from <i>Extrinsic Geometric Flows</i> which in turn is from Andrews's paper <i>Entropy estimates for evolving hypersurfaces</i>. For every compact strictly convex body \(K \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) with non-empty interior, the Gauss map \(G : \partial K \to S^n \) is a diffeomorphism from the hypersurface to sphere. Let \(\overline{\nabla}\) denote the standard connection on \(S^{n-1}\) with metric \(\overline{g}\). The inverse to Gauss map is given by \(X(z) = \sigma z + \overline{\nabla}\sigma\) where \(\sigma : S^n \to \mathbb{R}\) is the support function. This tells us that all information of the hypersurface is contained in the support function. This is exploited a lot in the book.  The operator \(A[\sigma]_{ij} = \overline{\nabla}_i\overline{\nabla}_j \sigma + \overline{g}_{ij}\sigma \) is the inverse of second fundamental form. Its eigenvalues at \(z\) are the principal radii of the hypersurface at \(X(z)\). By divergence formula on the position vector \[V(K) = \frac{1}{n+1}\int_{\partial K} X \cdot \nu d \mu = \frac{1}{n+1}\int_{\partial K}\sigma d\mu = \frac{1}{n+1}\int_{S^n}\sigma \det A[\sigma] d \bar{\mu}\]
      where the last equality uses the fact that determinant of the Gauss map is the Gauss curvature. Also recall that support function is additive under Minkowski addition. This means that we have a Steiner formula staring at us right now (and a little more). It is easy to see that \(V(K+tL)\) is a polynomial of degree \(n+1\) in \(t\). Moreover we can polarize it! Formally define \(V(K_0, \cdots, K_{n})\) as the coefficient of \(t_0 \ldots t_{n+1}\) in \(V(t_0 K_0 + \cdots + t_{n}K_{n})\). This coefficient will called the mixed volume of \(K_{i}\)'s and is totally symmetric. Algebraically, this will be the intgeration of mixed discriminant of principal radii of \(K_1, \ldots, K_{n}\) with support function of \(K_0\) (or any other order) like volume was integration of support function and product of principal radii. In formula \[V(K_0, \cdots, K_{n}) = \frac{1}{n+1} \int_{S^n} \sigma_{K_0} Q[\sigma_{K_1}, \ldots, \sigma_{K_n}]d \bar{\mu}\]
      where \(Q[\sigma_{K_1}, \ldots, \sigma_{K_n}] = \sum_{\tau, \eta \in S_n}\text{sgn}(\tau)\text{sgn}(\eta)A[\sigma_{K_1}]_{\tau(1)}^{\eta(1)} \ldots A[\sigma_{K_n}]_{\tau(n)}^{\eta(n)} \).</p>

      <p>A special case of this formula gives quermassintegrals. The \(j\)-th quermassintegral is defined as \(W_j(K) = V(\underbrace{K,\cdots, K}_{n-j \text{ times}}, \underbrace{B, \cdots, B}_{j \text{ times}})\) which make up the other coefficients in Steiner formula. A grand generalization of Brunn-Minkowski inequality is the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality \[V(K_1,K_2, \cdots , K_{n+1})^2 \ge V(K_1,K_1,K_3, \cdots, K_{n+1}) V(K_2,K_2,K_3, \cdots, K_{n+1})\]
      which is like a reverse Cauchy-Schwartz. Minkowski inequality \(V(K,L, \cdots L) \ge V(K)^{\frac{1}{n+1}} V(L)^{\frac{n}{n+1}} \) also follows. Schneider in his book <i>Convex Bodies: The Brunn-Minkowski Theory</i> mentions that Alexandrov gave two proofs (one only for \(C^2_+\) bodies) while Fenchel independently stated and proved but his proof was sketchy. Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality also appears in algebraic geometry somehow as Hodge index theorem. Also the fun doesn't stop here. Convex geometers have pushed the definition of mixed volumes for \(L^p\) additions as well and have proved Minkowski inequalities in \(L^p\)-Brunn-Minkowski theory as well.</p>

    <center><h3>20th Feb 2024</h3></center>
    <p>The spin variable had confused me for long enough in my undergrad when I studied QM. A majority of it boils down to the fact that \(SO(3)\) has fundamental group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) and \(SU(2)\) which is topologically \(S^3\) serves as double cover. So given a rotation matrix \(A \in SO(3)\), there are two non-homotopic paths from identity to \(A\). Also, looping a path twice gives a trivial loop in the fundamental group. Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrates the need to distinguish these paths which leads to hypothesis that electrons have an internal angular momentum </p>
    <center><h2 id="QM">Road to Quantum Mechanics</h2></center>
    <center><h3>20th Feb 2024</h3></center>
    <p>The aim here is to mark my progress in Quantum Mechanics. Again, I have been wanting to back to learn some QM and pick up some QFT. Hopefully I can mark some decent progress this time using my motivation to blog. My primary resource for now is Peter Woit's Quantum Theory, Groups and Representations: An Introduction. The text is good for starting from basics and spends a good amount of space developing prerequisites. Next plan is to use this to go through Folland's QFT for Mathematicians. Lets start with postulates.</p>
    <p> <b>Axiom</b> (States). The state of a quantum mechanical system is given by a nonzero vector in a complex vector space \(\mathcal{H}\) with Hermitian inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\).</p>
    <p><b>Axiom</b> (Quantum observables). The observables of a quantum mechanical system are given by self-adjoint linear operators on \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>
    <p><b>Axiom</b> (Dynamics). There is a distinguished quantum observable, the Hamiltonian \(\mathcal{H}\). Time evolution of states \( |\psi(t) \rangle \in \mathcal{H} \) is given by the Schrödinger equation 
    $$ i \hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = H |\psi(t)\rangle.$$
    The operator \(H\) has eigenvalues that are bounded below.</p>
    <p><b>Principle</b> (Observables). States for which the value of an observable can be characterized by a well-defined number are the states that are eigenvectors for the corresponding self-adjoint operator. The value of the observable in such a state will be a real number, the eigenvalue of the operator.</p>
    <p><b>Principle</b> (The Born rule). Given an observable \(O\) and two unit-norm states \(|\psi_1\rangle\) and \(\psi_2\rangle\) that are eigenvectors of \(O\) with distinct eigenvalues \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\)
      $$O|\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_1|\psi_1\rangle , \qquad O|\psi_2⟩ = \lambda_2|\psi_2 \rangle $$
      the complex linear combination state \(c_1|\psi_1 \rangle + c_2|\psi_2 \rangle\)
      will not have a well-defined value for the observable \(O\). If one attempts to measure this observable, one will get either \(\lambda_1\) or \(\lambda_2\), with probabilities
      $$ \frac{|c_1|^2}{|c_1|^2+|c_2|^2} \quad \text{ and }\quad \frac{|c_2|^2}{|c_1|^2+|c_2|^2}$$
      respectively.</p>
    <p>The most radical part of the theory is observable principle for me. It takes a lot of time to get comfortable with it. The new mathematical apparatus of Hilbert spaces and self-adjoint operator feels vastly different from classical mechanics where we are used to real functions describing the measurements. And the next departure is of course the probability one, that there are pure states and mixed states. A particle in mixed state can give two different measurement values with a certain probability. One has to remind themselves that this is still a model of physical reality, a very close one but a mathematical model with great accuracy.</p>
    <center><h2 id="Gaugetheory">A look into Gauge Theory</h2></center>
    <center><h3>10th Feb 2024</h3></center>
    <p>I have been interested in learning preliminaries to gauge theory since sometime and have looked into the basic setup. It can be defined as study of connections on a metric vector bundle with specific interest in invariant connections coming from Yang-Mills functional. Let \(E\) be a vector bundle over a manifold \(M\) equipped with some metric. A connection on \(E\) is a bundle map 
      $$\nabla : TM \otimes \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E) \qquad \text{or} \qquad
      \nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E) \otimes T^*M.$$ 
    such that \(\nabla_X(fs) = f\nabla_X(s)+ (Xf)s\).</p>

    <p>This should be thought of as a rule to differentiate a section in a direction (the \(1\)-form eats that direction to give the section on the right side).</p> -->
    <!--<center><h2 id="QM">The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h2></center>
    <center><h3>15th June 2023</h3></center>
    <p>Nature threw a big tantrum when she decided fundamental laws of the nature are quantum and not classical. I have always struggled with understanding quantum mechanics at axiomatic level. One big jump was that physical observables are not real functions on phase space but rather linear operators on a Hilbert space whose eigenvalues contain information about states.</p> 

    <p>I will be writing down the postulates mainly from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page and Gregory Naber's book <i>Quantum Mechanics</i>.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="box"><b>Postulate 1</b>. Every isolated quantum system is associated with a separable, complex Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\). The pure states of the system are represented by vectors \(\psi \in \mathcal{H}\) with \(|| \psi || = 1 \) and for any complex number \(\alpha\) with \(|\alpha |=1 \), \(\psi\) and \(\alpha \psi\) represent the same state. \(\mathcal{H}\) is called the <i>state space</i>.</div>

    <p>The explanation for separable condition on Wikipedia is that we should be able to determine the system by countably many observables. It's a valid assumption, but things can get so philosophical here. This is the first time I am seeing the mathematics of infinity coming into physical systems where it makes a difference (or not, it's just a model anyway). All \(n\)-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces are isomorphic as are all separable infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. Usually we will choose \(\mathcal{H}\) as some \(L^2\) space. Also, Naber states that it's not that every unit vector represent a physical state but all states are unit vectors. Composite systems are be tensor products of Hilbert spaces. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="box"><b>Composite systems</b>. The Hilbert space of a composite system is the tensor product of the state spaces.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="box"><b>Postulate 2</b>. For a quantum state with Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), every observable is identified with a self-adjoint operator \(A : \mathcal{D}(A) \to \mathcal{H}\) and any possible outcome of a measurement of the observable is a real number which must be an eigenvalue of the operator.</div>

    <p>Examples of observables include energy, momentum, position etc. Also, the operators can be unbounded, so need not be continuous.</p>-->

    <center><h2 id="Why-MCF">Why Mean Curvature Flow</h2></center>
    <center><h3>5th May 2023</h3></center>
    <p>The Mean curvature flow is an extrinsic flow on immersed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space or arbitrary Riemannian manifold. It is the negative gradient of the volume functional so not a completely unmotivated object. The main thing which makes it work in some natural way is the codimension one condition; however generalizations to higher codimension hypersurfaces exist. </p>
    <p>Why do we want to study this flow and if we do what results can we achieve? To start with it is a very natural flow to consider on hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. It bends the higher curved parts with more speed than the lower curved parts to uniformize the curvature across the hypersurface. The one dimensional case which is called the curve shortening flow has been a very successful test of this flow. Also, the parabolic nature of the equation directly gives short time existence and uniqueness; so we know that given a hypersurface we have one way to evolve to possibly study its geometry. For its twin ''Ricci flow'' as Hamilton calls it the motivation was uniformizing Riemannian manifolds with an eye towards Poincare&#769 conjecture. This is of course with benefit of hindsight after Perelman's seminal resolution using surgery methods. For Yamabe flow the plan was also clear - solve the PDE and get a conformal metric with uniform scalar curvature.
    </p>
    <p>So the question begs itself : What do we want to do with the Mean curvature flow on hypersurfaces? A generic answer is to study the geometry of hypersurfaces and attempt a classification. This is severely restricted by the assumption of mean convexity (\(H >0\) everywhere) which makes the maximum principle work in several cases. Huisken's result on the convergence of convex hypersurfaces into a round sphere is the first step towards it, but it doesn't achieve much topologically. A uniformly convex hypersurface is diffeomorphic to a unit sphere by Gauss map, to begin with. For non-convex hypersurface singularities might develop which prohibit a direct analysis. To overcome this we blow up the manifold near singularity and this limiting process gives an ancient solution. So we shift our attention to the classification of ancient solutions which is still a difficult problem. <!--Angenent-Daskalopoulos-Sesum and Brendle-Choi have obtained results in this direction without self-similarity conditions.-->
    </p>

    <p>Another direction in which the mean curvature flow is being explored is the Lagrangian Mean curvature flow in order to find special Lagrangians inside symplectic manifolds. This is related to a problem in symplectic geometry(?) and in the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds the condition of being Lagrangian is preserved under Mean curvature flow.
    </p>
      
    <p>Mean curvature flow can also be potentially used to find nice codimension one hypersurface inside Riemannian manifolds. Lawson conjecture is one example of it. It states that the Clifford torus is the only minimally embedded torus in \(S^3\). While Brendle's proof of Lawson conjecture didn't directly involve the flow however it did use some techniques coming from his sharp estimate analysis of the inscribed radius in noncollapsing. From what I have read on the internet Yau gave a big push for the question of finding minimal surfaces inside Riemannian manifolds. I don't know why this is an interesting question to consider and what we can get out of it.
    </p>
    <!--<p>So far the most impressive results for me have been Huisken’s result on convex hypersurfaces, Huisken-Sinestrari’s result on the classification of 2-convex hypersurfaces using MCF with surgery, and the very geometric idea of noncollapsing by Sheng, Wang, and Andrews. To be honest noncollapsing looked like a surprise. </p>-->
    <center><h2 id="OnGeometry">On Geometry in General</h2></center>
    <center><h3>2nd May 2023</h3></center>
    <p>Disclaimer: I am still largely inexperienced in the ways of geometry. These are just some thoughts I have collected over the years and need not be accurate, but I still wanted to share. <!--Also, this one will be a descriptive article with almost no technical details.--></p>
    <p> It has been a long pressing question for me to find out what is the goal of doing differential geometry in the large and what is the future of the field. A typical question to throw is the classification problem - if you're doing algebra classify all groups, rings, modules, fields; if you're doing analysis classify all Hilbert spaces, functions between spaces; if you're doing topology classify all spaces up-to homeomorphism and it is a great question to ask in geometry as well. What are all the Riemannian/complex/symplectic manifolds? Like other subfields this seems to be an incredibly difficult and almost unsolvable problem. </p>
    <p> So we do what is most common and add more conditions/structures on manifolds. The question of what good manifolds are is a tricky one I feel. One condition to consider is possession of a large isometry group, i.e. the best manifold should be very symmetric. A popular definition in this regard is the definition of homogenous spaces. A space \(X\) is said to be homogenous if it is equipped with a transitive action of a group \(G\).  This is pretty close to the spirit of Erlangen program.</p>
    <p>At Sorbonne my advisors Prof. Alix Deruelle and Prof. Gilles Courtois introduced me to a question by Heinz Hopf of finding the best metric on a given smooth manifold. Best is subjective and we can have various definitions. In fact there is an entire book <i>A Perspective on Canonical Riemannian Metrics</i> by Giovanni Catino and Paolo Mistrolia which explores some meanings one can associate with the best metric. This is a also a chapter in Berger's book <i>A Panaromic View of Riemannian Geometry</i>. For two dimensions the problem is easy to consider and has been solved for compact manifolds. Here the best metric is the metric with constant curvature and Uniformization theorem gives a complete answer. For three dimension there is Thurston's conjecture that one can break a three manifold into pieces with canonical geometry but I am not really familiar with this theory (there is a lot happening on the topological side as well).</p>
    <p> Another approach considered for best metric is to think of metrics coming from critical values of a functional. One example is the scalar curvature functional which gives Einstein metrics as critical metrics. On the complex side there is a subfield based out of study of critical points of the Calabi functional which I am completely unaware of. </p>
    <p>There is a very interesting paper by Chern called 'Differential Geometry: Its past and its future' which gives an overview. Another source of a broad perspective of geometry (or more specifically geometric analysis) I recently got to know about is Yau's big <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602363" target="_blank">survey paper</a> which will be an ambitious read if I am ever able to complete it. </p>
